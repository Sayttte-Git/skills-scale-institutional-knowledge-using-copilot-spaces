# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome! This repository contains the standardized project management processes and resources used by the OctoAcme team to deliver high-quality products efficiently and collaboratively.

## Summary of Project Management Processes

OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative approach to project management that emphasizes customer value, clear ownership, and continuous improvement. Our project lifecycle consists of five key stages: **Initiation**, where we validate business needs and define success metrics; **Planning**, where we break work into actionable increments and identify dependencies; **Execution**, where teams build, test, and iterate on features while tracking progress; **Release & Deployment**, where we standardize how features reach production with proper verification and rollback plans; and **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**, where we capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

Our process is built on core principles that guide every project: prioritizing customer value and usability (customer-first), delivering small testable increments (iterative delivery), ensuring each project has named owners (clear ownership), making data-informed decisions based on evidence and metrics, and fostering psychological safety to encourage feedback and learning. These principles create an environment where teams can deliver reliably while continuously improving their practices.

Project delivery involves clearly defined roles and responsibilities. The **Project Manager (PM)** coordinates delivery schedules, manages risks, and facilitates communication across teams. The **Product Manager (PdM)** defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success against customer and business goals. **Developers** implement features and collaborate on design and testability, while **QA/Testing** validates quality against acceptance criteria. **Stakeholders** provide essential inputs and approvals throughout the lifecycle. This role clarity ensures accountability and smooth collaboration across cross-functional teams.

Communication and quality assurance are integrated throughout our process. Teams maintain regular cadences including daily standups, weekly syncs between PM and PdM, and monthly stakeholder updates. Quality is ensured through comprehensive testing strategies (unit, integration, and end-to-end tests), automated CI pipelines with security scanning, code review practices with clear PR conventions, and risk management through maintained risk registers. All projects use consistent artifacts such as Project Charters, Roadmaps, Sprint Backlogs, Acceptance Criteria, Risk Registers, and Retrospective notes to maintain transparency and alignment.

## How to Use These Docs

- **New team members**: Start with the [Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md) to understand our approach, then explore specific guides relevant to your role.
- **Project teams**: Reference the phase-specific guides (Initiation, Planning, Execution, etc.) as your project progresses through its lifecycle.
- **Process improvements**: Contribute updates through pull requests, and add context to `.copilot/` if you want Copilot Spaces to use them as reference material.
